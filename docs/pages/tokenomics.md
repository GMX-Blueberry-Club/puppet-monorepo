# Tokenomics

Puppet uses VotingEscrow for governance and to distribute rewards. The system has a few novel features:

- **Revenue-Driven Emissions**: With an unfixed supply, tokens are minted based on user-driven revenue and are rewarded back through a dynamic flywheel mechanism.
- **Reward Options**: Users can lock earned tokens for increased rewards and governance rights, or opt for immediate liquidity.
- **Revenue-Driven Buyback**: Revenue is used to buy back Puppet tokens, which are then distributed to users who commit to long-term locking
- **Decentralization of Ownership**: The foundation's ability to earn tokens based on protocol performance decreases over time, promoting a more decentralized ownership structure.

## Revenue-Driven Emissions

At the core of Puppet's design is the principle that contributors to the protocol's success should be rewarded. As the protocol generates more user-driven revenue, additional tokens are minted and distributed to active participants, fostering a cycle of mutual success. Our token supply directly reflects the protocol's growth and usage, avoiding arbitrary or exessive inflation that could deter new participants

## Reward Options

### Lock In

For every dollar of revenue generated, earn a corresponding amount in PUPPET tokens. Lock them as vePUPPET for up to two years. A longer lockups yield greater bonus with increased earned rewards generated through revenue and governance rights, catering to long-term investors

### Cash Out

Immediately receive a portion of your revenue in PUPPET tokens. This option caters to those who prefer immediate returns

## Revenue-Driven Buyback

Puppet earns revenue from opening and maintaining positions. It uses this income to buy back PUPPET tokens by publically auctioning it's earned revenue. the tokens are then distributed to owners who locked their tokens

## Decentralization of Ownership

Ensuring that the foundation's success is shared and that ownership becomes increasingly decentralized. By reducing the foundation's minting capabilities over time, we lay the groundwork for governance and ownership to transition to new core contributors and stakeholders. This move towards decentralization is both an acknowledgment of blockchain principles and a strategic decision for Puppet's longevity

## Governance and Adaptability

Reward rates (up to 100% in WETH for Lock, 33.3% in PUPPET for Exit) can change through governance votes. This keeps rewards fair over time
