# Tokenomics

Puppet use VotingEscrow both for governance and reward distribution

the tokenomics has key novel ideas;

- tokens are minted dynamically based on protocol performance without a fixed supply. this allows the protocol to mint tokens based on the value contributed by it's users
- the platform incentives users to lock their tokens to align commitment but also gives the ability to earn liquid tokens and take a quick reward if they choose to
- the protocol long term endgame is to pass ownership from the foundation to it's users where the foundation can mint 50% of the generated supply over time but the % is decreasing over time, i.e 25% will be able to minted in the second year and 15% on the third

## Revenue Mechanism and Distribution Overview

The platform generates revenue through GMX referral links and other incentives. All revenue is given back to users in the form of PUPPET and WETH tokens. Whenever rewards can be claimed, users must choose between "Lock" to build a position or "Exit" for an immediate gain, each option aligns with different financial goals and commitment levels

## Binary Option

### Lock Option

Users can mint PUPPET tokens equivalent to up to $100 for every $100 of platform revenue they generate. These tokens will be converted into vePUPPET tokens for a duration of up to 2 years. Opting for a 1-year lock-in translates to a 50% conversion rate, while the maximum full 2-year commitment yields a 100% conversion rate. This option is designed for users with a long-term vision while tapping up to 100% in the generated platform's revenue and governance rights.

### Exit Option

Alternatively, contributors can immediately claim one-third of their generated revenue ($33.3 for every $100) in PUPPET tokens. This option caters to those seeking immediate returns while giving up on any platform revenue.

Core Principles

- Equitable Distribution: Rewards are directly proportional to individual contributions.
- Shared Ownership: The alignment of user and protocol incentives fosters collective growth.
- Incentive Alignment: The system promotes both immediate participation and enduring involvement.

Governance and Flexibility

The reward percentages (up to 100% in WETH for the Stake option and 33.3% in PUPPET for the Exit option) are adjustable via governance proposals. This flexibility ensures the reward structure remains balanced over time.
