# Tokenomics

Puppet's smart contracts integrate a simple emissions model. Tokens are minted and rewarded as the protocol's revenue grows, aligning token supply with actual usage and preventing inflation that could deter new users

## Features

- **Initial Supply**: Begins with zero liquid supply and 100,000 locked tokens for market liquidity. no VC or Foundation tokens are allocated
- **Revenue-Driven Emissions**: Tokens are minted based on active protocol use. Each PUPPET token earned corresponds to a dollar of revenue generated
- **Reward Options**: Users can lock earned tokens for increased rewards and governance rights, or opt for immediate liquidity.
- **Revenue-Driven Buyback**: Revenue is used to buy back tokens, distributed to users who commit to long-term locking
- **Foundation Emission**: Earns a share of the tokens minted based on protocol performance, share factor decreases over time to promote decentralization

## Revenue-Driven Emissions

Tokens are minted and distributed to active participants as the protocol generates more revenue. This ensures that the token supply directly reflects the protocol's growth and usage, avoiding arbitrary or excessive inflation that could deter new participants

## Reward Options

Puppet offers flexible reward options to cater to different types of users:

### Lock In

For every dollar of revenue generated, earn a corresponding amount in PUPPET tokens, Users can lock their tokens as vePUPPET for up to two years. Longer lockups yield greater bonuses, with increased rewards generated through revenue and governance rights. This option is ideal for long-term investors who believe in the protocol's future and are willing to commit their tokens for extended periods

### Cash Out

For those who prefer immediate returns, Puppet provides the option to immediately receive a portion of their revenue in PUPPET tokens. This caters to users who prioritize liquidity over long-term rewards

## Revenue-Driven Buyback

Protocol fees like maintaining positions is used to buy back PUPPET tokens. This is done through public contract auctions of the earned revenue. The bought-back tokens are then distributed to locked contributors. This ensures that revenue generated by the protocol is reinvested back to active participants in the flywheel

## Foundation Share

The foundation's ability to earn tokens based on protocol performance decreases gradually, promoting a more decentralized ownership structure. By reducing the foundation's minting capabilities, Puppet ensures that governance and ownership transition to new core contributors and stakeholders. This move towards decentralization aligns with blockchain principles and is a strategic decision for Puppet's longevity

## Governance and Adaptability

Puppet's governance model allows for adaptability in reward rates. Reward rates, such as up to 100% in WETH for Lock and 33.3% in PUPPET for Exit, can be adjusted through governance votes. This ensures that rewards remain fair and competitive over time, adapting to the evolving needs of the community
